:: SUBDIRECTORIES
=================

``antivir/``
* Scripts to quickly search for offensive patterns inside PDF documents.
  - detectsig.rb: Search for a signature inside PDF objects (using
    PDF#grep method).

  - extractjs.rb: Search and extract all JS scripts from documents
    (using PDF#ls method).

  - pdfcleanr.rb: deactivate some "features" of the PDF language. 
    Actions, trigger events and form actions can be turned off. This
    is done by swapping the case of these keywords (as PDF language is
    case sensitive).

``samba/``
* Implementation of a SMB relay attack using PDF. When opened in a
  browser on Windows, the document tries to access a document shared
  on a malicious SMB server (on a LAN). The server will then be able
  to steal user credentials. This script merely forges the malicious
  PDF document.

``exploits/``
* Basic exploits PoC generation.
